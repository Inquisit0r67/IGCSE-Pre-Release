Some Infromation

The exam board have saide that they will be looking mostly at the logic of the code in our exams and that sytanx isnt scrutinised as much.
My code does use features we have not studied in our course, but an assesment specialist has said: 

  >*"There is no single programmed solution to the tasks, the tasks have to be solved using a high-level procedural programming language   of    your choice and they can all be undertaken using the requirements of the syllabus. However, candidates are free to use more advanced      programming techniques to enhance or refine their solutions if they wish. Their work will be rewarded if the solution provided solves      the   pre-release task and addresses the associated question. It is likely that candidates within a given class will produce different    programmed solutions to the tasks and discussion between candidates and teacher is encouraged. Candidates who explore the tasks and        find  different programmed ways of solving them tend to have a deeper understanding of why one way might be more suitable than another    and consequently are able to provide more depth in their responses in the questions relating to the pre-release tasks on Paper 2. As      you will see in the Mark Schemes for previous papers, the answers shown are only one example of a suitable solution. Other acceptable      programming    methods and programming answers are given credit."* 
  (Sir has put this statement on Teams btw.)

So infact using different solutions using more programming techniques is sort of encouraged as it will increase your understanding of our pre release material in preperation for our exam on it.
In short if your solution ticks all the boxes in the pre release requirement, it should be given credit.

  > *"...As long as a candidateâ€™s interpretation is supported by a logical approach that is appropriate to the task, the work is            rewarded."*
